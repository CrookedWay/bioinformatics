For the start of this project, this will be our idea page. People can post ideas here that could lead to projects.
Additionally, if people have journal articles or software tools that they think could be useful/worthwhile to discuss, 
this could be a good space to put those during our discussion. For organization, you should create a 
section with your name/identifier, and underneath that put whatever you want to dicuss. This will allow others to 
follow your ideas and thought processes as they develop.
